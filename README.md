# TwoChainzMe
Alexa Skill that recites a random 2 Chainz Lyric

## Getting Started
Execute the following command to create a `node_modules` directory. This directory
is needed when the entire directory is zipped and uploaded to AWS Lambda.
```
npm install --save alexa-sdk
```

## Future Releases
1. Connect Genius API to grab from a directory of 2 Chainz Lines
2. Retrieve other artists' lyrics (possibly in another skill)
